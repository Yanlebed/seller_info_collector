Problem we set out to solve
Identify Amazon listings across EU marketplaces (ES, FR, IT, NL, SE) that should have EPREL energy labels but donâ€™t, so brands can be contacted to fix compliance issues.
Purpose and goals
Collect links to candidate products per country/category (Module 1).
Visit each product and extract details (brand, seller, ASIN, URL, category, energy info status) with robust navigation (cookies, intermediate pages, location settings) and resume capability (Module 2).
Produce clean, consolidated datasets:
Per-country product files and brand summaries.
Global all_products_extracted.xlsx and all_brands_analysis_extracted.xlsx.
Generate personalized outreach messages per brand, and take a small, representative set of screenshots for brands with many affected products, with resume and proper foldering.
Key challenges we hit (and fixed)
Browser setup issues (missing setup_camoufox, dependency installs, geoip extra, viewport arg).
Flaky navigation due to cookie banners and intermediate pages; added robust handlers and delays.
Resume requirements after interruptions (e.g., Spain partial run) for both link collection and data extraction.
Normalizing brand names and detecting product vs. search result pages for screenshots.
Data consolidation: schema compatibility and avoiding duplicates when appending Spain.
